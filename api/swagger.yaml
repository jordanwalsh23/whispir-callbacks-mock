  description: "Whispir's Callback functionality allows customers applications to\
    \ receive responses to messages directly to their applications via a JSON or XML\
    \ POST request from Whispir.\n\nCustomers can provide a URL to Whispir, and specify\
    \ an authorization header or query parameter to provide Whispir authorization\
    \ to access the provided callback service.\n\nCustomers can use this API to create\
    \ new callback services, and update or delete existing callback services.\n\n\
    Callbacks can be invoked by including the supplied `callbackName` parameter in\
    \ the request to the `messages` endpoint. \n\nFor example:\n\n```\n  POST https://api.whispir.com/messages?apikey=abc123\n\
    \  \n  {\n    \"to\" : \"61400000000\",\n    \"subject\" : \"Demonstration Message\"\
    ,\n    \"body\" : \"This is the sample SMS Content\",\n    \"callbackId\" : \"\
    My Callback Service\"\n  }\n```\n\nEvery attempt to POST information to the callback\
    \ URL is stored as a `call` against the particular Callback record.\n\nCustomers\
    \ can query this information by making a `GET` request to the `/callbacks/{id}/calls`\
    \ endpoint.  This provides a list of both SUCCESS and FAILED calls to the specified\
    \ callback.\n\nIn the event the customer would like to reprocess any FAILED callbacks\
    \ in their system, they can consume the information using the `calls` endpoint,\
    \ and once successfully SUCCESS, the particular call can be updated using the\
    \ `PUT /callbacks/{id}/calls?id[]={id}` endpoint.\n\nMaking this update will update\
    \ the status of the provided `call` IDs to `SUCCESS` so these will not be returned\
    \ with the next query for FAILED calls.\n\n*Note:* This swagger definition references\
    \ `applications/json` as the content type that should be used.  In a production\
    \ capacity, the actual Accept and Content-Type headers should be:\n\n- `application/vnd.whispir.api-callback-v1+json`\
    \ for Callbacks endpoints\n- `application/vnd.whispir.api-call-v1+json` for Calls\
    \ endpoints\n\nMore information about Whispir's API Callbacks functionality can\
    \ be found in the Whispir API Documentation available at https://whispir.github.io/api.\n"
